# A little history of creating of this repository:
In one store of the mall, my wife saw a notebook with a black cover and decided to buy it for recipes. I followed her and decided to get the same one for myself. She was a little upset that we would have the same notebooks and I suggested that she get a red one, since she likes red among other colors. I got it for myself for notes on my studies. When I got home, I had an idea that appeared thanks to Shirley, my wife: "Why not create a script instead of recording commands in the terminal in a notebook that will do the same thing without having to run commands one by one manually?". This is how the first script appeared in this repository, called start.sh. "Start" by starting to modify fresh system for using it as web-server from this script.
